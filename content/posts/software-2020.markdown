A few applications that I find worth using in 2020.

[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) - \*Nix terminal multiplexer, allows you to easily multitask in a terminal by providing resizable terminal 'windows'.

[ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) - A quote from the project's README describes this terminal enhancer accurately: "Oh My Zsh will not make you a 10x developer...but you may feel like one."

[Portainer](https://github.com/portainer/portainer) - A super easy to use web interface for [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and recently also [Kubernetes](https://www.docker.com/products/kubernetes). 

[macpass](https://macpassapp.org/) - Use to generate, store and retrieve unique credentials on macOS.
