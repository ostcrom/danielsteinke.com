    <p>This article is meant to serve as a broad overview for <strong>Why</strong> and <strong>How</strong> modern webpages have moved away from dynamically generated web pages, which were the cornerstone of the "Web 2.0" era. Deployments are trending back towards static web pages, even on websites that contain dynamic content. This method of serving web content relies on modern cloud infrastructure services likes content delivery networks, object storage and edge computing to scale for capacity in an incredibly cost efficient and effortless manner.</p>
<h4>There are three major pieces which are needed to deploy a "Serverless" web page:</h4>
<ol>
<li>A way to create and update the web site.</li>
<li>A method of deploying said website.</li>
<li>A platform or service provider to host the web site on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Astute readers will already recognize there is no such thing as a "serverless" website. This term refers more to the concept of being able to easily deploy a web application on third party "Backend as a Service" (BaaS) platforms. Static content is typically served from an object storage service, while dynamic content/calls are handled by "serverless functions." These serverless functions are typically scripts with a single function, that are called when an event is triggered, such as a request to a particular web path or end point.</p>
<p>In more practical terms what this means is instead of deploying a full blown CMS like WordPress you would instead deploy a static site that is edited offline. This site would likely be generated by a "headless" CMS, covered in the next section. The static site would be uploaded to a web host, object storage or it might get pushed directly to a Content Delivery Network, which is where the content would ultimately be served from in any case. Dynamic content would be loaded by JavaScript functions "baked in" to the static site which would make calls to Serverless Function scripts and use the returned information to modify the HTML output in browser.</p>

<h2>Creating and Uploading the Site</h2>
<p>Creating the site requires a framework that allows for static page generation or a "headless" CMS.</p>
